a. Scope risk 
o	The project team may not identify all the deliverables, requiring changes later.  
o	Individuals may add features to the product that were not approved. 
b. Scheduling risk 
o	The project could fall into the trap of scheduling deadlines because of ideal, fast-paced timeline, instead of a slower, perhaps more realistic timeline.  
o	The project difficulty is underestimated, so the project cannot be finished within time. 
c. Resource risk 
o	The project cannot find a skilled technician to finish the task within the scheduled time frame.  
o	The project runs out of budget before projectâ€™s completion. 
d. Technology risk 
o	The subscribed software cannot fulfil the task that it was supposed to.  
o	When transferring data from one platform to another, there might be delay.
